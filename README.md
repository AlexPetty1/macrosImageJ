This is a repository has all the imagej macros, I worked on inside the OSU marine insect lab.
All are free to use, modify, or take parts of.

Tutorials on how to use each macro along with classifications can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1y29dr4GDW3ISDtQPe0aHDDvShmG96R9y
